Run `coderabbit review --plain` and analyze the output.

For each issue found:
1. **Apply** fixes for: bugs, security issues, and clear improvements
2. **Skip** and briefly note why for: stylistic preferences, over-engineering suggestions, or changes that don't fit our codebase patterns
3. **Ask me** about: architectural changes or anything ambiguous

Summarize what you changed and what you skipped at the end.
